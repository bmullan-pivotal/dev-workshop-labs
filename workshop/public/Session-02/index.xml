      <description>In this lab we will become comfortable with running ASP.NET Core Web applications locally on our PC and publishing and deploying them to Cloud Foundry.
 We will be using a Fortune Teller micro-services based application as our sample. The app consists of a Fortune Teller Service which provides a REST API to serve up Fortunes and a Fortune Teller UI that can be used to display the Fortunes. In its current state, this app is not fully functional.</description>

      <description>Starting with this lab we will begin the process of creating a fully functional Fortune Teller application which uses several of the Steeltoe components. You have two paths you can follow when doing the rest of the labs for the workshop:
  For each lab, open up and work with finished code. With this path you won&amp;#8217;t be writing any new code, instead, you will just be reviewing and running already completed lab code.</description>
