= Lab 7 - Configuration and Steeltoe Config Server Client

[abstract]
--
In this lab we will continue to add functionality to the Fortune Teller application.
We will explore how to use the ASP.NET Core Configuration services and how to add the Spring Cloud Config Server as a source of configuration data using the Steeltoe Config Server provider.

If you started with the _FortuneTeller.sln_, and completed Lab06, the app in its current state is still not fully functional:

. The ``Fortune Teller Service`` uses a backend in-memory datastore to hold Fortunes.
. The ``Fortune Teller Service`` serves up random fortunes from the datastore.
. The ``Fortune Teller UI`` uses a ``FortuneServiceClient`` but it doesn't know how to communicate with the ``Fortune Teller Service`` yet.

The goals for Lab 7 are to:

. Understand ASP.NET Core Configuration.
. Understand ASP.NET Core Enironments
. Understand ASP.NET Core Options services.
. Use Environments to have seperate configuration for ``Development`` and ``Production``.
. Use Options to configure the ``FortuneServiceClient`` with the address of the ``Fortune Teller Service``
. Use Spring Cloud Config Server to centralize configurations

For some background information on ASP.NET Core Configuration, have a look at this https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration[documentation].

For some background information on ASP.NET Core Environments, have a look at this https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/environments[documentation].

And finally, for some background information on ASP.NET Core Options, have a look at this https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration#options-config-objects[documentation].

== Open Visual Studio Solution
. Start Visual Studio and open the solution/folder you wish to use:
.. _Workshop/Session-03/Lab07.sln_ if you want to start with finished code.
.. _Workshop/FortuneTeller/FortuneTeller.sln_ if you are writing code from scratch.

== Understanding ASP.NET Core Configuration, Environment and Options
. Expand the ``Fortune-Teller-UI`` project
. Open and examine ``Startup.cs``, as this is where the configuration is built
.. Examine ``ConfigurationBuilder`` and ``SetBasePath``
.. Examine ``AddJsonFile()`` methods.  These are adding Configuration sources to the ``ConfigurationBuilder``.
... Notice the  ``AddEnvironmentVariables()`` as another provider added to builder.
... Understand Environments (e.g. Development, Staging, etc) and ``IHostingEnvironment.EnvironmentName``
... Understand setting Environments using ``ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT`` and point out ``launchSettings.json``
.. Examine the arguments to ``AddJsonFile``
.. Notice ``appsettings-<<EnvironmentName>>.json`` is not present.
.. Notice ``Configuration = builder.Build()``. It actually builds the configuration at this point.
... Understand how one providers configuration values can override the others.
.. Open ``appsettings.json``. Current contents is used to configuring logging.
... Notice ``loggerFactory.AddConsole(...)`` in ``Configure`` method.

== Use different configurations for development and production.
In this exercise we will be creating a ``appsettings-Development.json`` file that will hold the configuration data for when we are running in ``Development`` mode.

=== Step 01 - Add appsettings-Development.json configuration source
Here we add a JSON configuration file to each project which contains configuration parameters specific to when we are running in ``Development`` mode.
Basically, we are going to change all logging to ``Debug`` when running the app in ``Development`` mode.

. Expand the ``Fortune-Teller-UI`` project
.. Add new json file ``appsettings-Development.json`` if it doesn't already exist.
.. Copy contents of ``appsettings.json`` to ``appsetttings-Development.json``.
.. Modify all ``LogLevels`` to ``Debug``.
.. Then also add ``"Fortune_Teller_Service": "Debug"`` and ``"Fortune_Teller_UI": "Debug"`` to end of the file.
. Expand ``Fortune-Teller-Service`` project
.. Do the same steps as above.
. Save all files and when you're done both projects ``appsettings-Development.json`` files should look like:

+
----
{
  "Logging": {
    "IncludeScopes": false,
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Debug",
      "System": "Debug",
      "Microsoft": "Debug",
      "Fortune_Teller_Service": "Debug",
      "Fortune_Teller_UI": "Debug"
    }
  }
}
----

=== Step 02 - Run Locally
At this point you should be ready to run both Fortune-Tellers locally and test:

. Using the skills you picked up from Lab05, run the apps from VS2017 and/or from the command line.
.. CTRL-F5 or F5 in VS2017
.. ``dotnet run --server.urls http://*:5000`` - Fortune-Teller-Service
.. ``dotnet run --server.urls http://*:5555`` - Fortune-Teller-UI
. Modify ``ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT`` in ``launchsettings.json`` for each project and verify you are getting the appropriate logging information when you run the application.
.. Hint: Amoung other places, look at the ``FortunesController`` action methods for logging calls.
. Change the log levels in  ``appsettings-Development.json`` while ``Fortune-Teller-Service`` and ``Fortune-Teller-UI`` are running to see if changes are picked up.

== Use Options to configure the FortuneServiceClient
In this exercise we will be using the ASP.NET Core Configuration and Options services to inject configuration data into the ``FortuneServiceClient``.
The configuration data will be put in the Fortune-Teller-UIs ``appsettings.json`` file, as that's what uses the ``FortuneServiceClient``.
We will use the already existing ``FortuneServiceConfig`` class to hold the config data from ``appsettings.json``.

=== Step 01 - Add configuration data to appsettings.json

. Expand the ``Common\Services`` folder and open ``FortuneServiceConfig``.
.. Notice the POCO has four properties for holding the configuration data:
* Scheme
* Address
* RandomFortunePath
* AllFortunesPath
. Expand the ``Fortune-Teller-UI`` project
.. Open up ``appsettings.json`` and add the following to the file:
+
----
"fortuneService": {
    "scheme": "http",
    "address":"localhost:5000",
    "randomFortunePath": "api/fortunes/random",
    "allFortunesPath": "api/fortunes/all"
  }
----
{sp}+
Notice that we are adding a section named ``fortuneService`` and then adding sub-items with names that match the ``FortuneServiceConfig`` POCO properties.

=== Step 02 - Add FortuneServiceConfig to Container

. Expand the ``Fortune-Teller-UI`` project
.. Open ``Startup`` class and locate the ``Configure()`` method - the one that configures the container!
.. Add the call to ``Configure<FortuneServiceConfig>(...)``
+
----
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddSingleton<IFortuneService, FortuneServiceClient>();

    services.Configure<FortuneServiceConfig>(Configuration.GetSection("fortuneService"));

    // Add framework services.
    services.AddMvc();
}
----
{sp}+
The changes to this method actually cause several things to happen:
* It uses the configuration we built in the ``Startup`` constructor and gets the ``fortuneService`` section from it.
* It passes that configuration data into the ``Configure<FortuneServiceConfig>`` which binds the values from the configuration into the properties in ``FortuneServiceConfig``.
* And, finally it will make ``FortuneServiceConfig`` available for inject as a ``IOptions<FortuneServiceConfig>`` or ``IOptionsSnapshot<FortuneServiceConfig>``.

=== Step 03 - Update FortuneServiceClient to use FortuneServiceConfig
. Expand the ``Fortune-Teller-UI`` project
. Open ``FortuneServiceClient`` class and add the field and modify the constructor as follows:
+
----
IOptionsSnapshot<FortuneServiceConfig> _config;
public FortuneServiceClient(IOptionsSnapshot<FortuneServiceConfig> config, ILogger<FortuneServiceClient> logger)
{
    _logger = logger;
    _config = config;
}
----

. Modify ``AllFortunesAsync()`` and ``RandomFortuneAsync()`` to make the calls to the ``Fortune Teller Service``:
+
----
public async Task<List<Fortune>> AllFortunesAsync()
{
    return await HandleRequest<List<Fortune>>(_config.Value.AllFortunesURL());
}

public async Task<Fortune> RandomFortuneAsync()
{
    return await HandleRequest<Fortune>(_config.Value.RandomFortuneURL());
}
----

=== Step 04 - Run Locally
At this point you should be ready to run both Fortune-Tellers locally and test.
The ``Fortune-Teller-UI`` should now be fetching Fortunes from the ``Fortune-Teller-Service``.

. Using the skills you picked up from Lab05, run the apps from VS2017 and/or from the command line.
.. CTRL-F5 or F5 in VS2017
.. ``dotnet run --server.urls http://*:5000`` - Fortune-Teller-Service
.. ``dotnet run --server.urls http://*:5555`` - Fortune-Teller-UI

== Use Spring Cloud Config Server as a Configuration source
In this exercise we will startup a Spring Cloud Config Server locally and move some of our configuration data to the locally running Config Server.
We also make the changes necessary to use the Config Server from our application. Specifically, we will use the Steeltoe Config Server client to pull config data from the Config Server.

For some background information on Spring Cloud Config Server, have a look at this http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/Camden.SR4/#_spring_cloud_config[documentation].
For some background information on Steeltoe Config Server client, have a look at this https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Configuration/tree/master/src/Steeltoe.Extensions.Configuration.ConfigServer[documentation].
For other samples (ASP.NET Core and 4.x) that use the Steeltoe Config Server client, have a look https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples/tree/master/Configuration[here].

=== Step 01 - Run Spring Cloud Config Server Locally
Here we do the steps to setup and run a Spring Cloud Config Server locally so its easier to develop and test with.

. To run Config Server you will need Java JDK installed on your machine and the JAVA_HOME environment variable set to the JDK's installed location:
+
----
e.g. JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_112 or equivalent on Linux/Mac
----

. Open a command window.

. Change directory to _Workshop/ConfigServer_
+
----
> cd Workshop\ConfigServer
----

. Startup the config server
+
----
> mvnw spring-boot:run
----
{sp}+
It will start up on port 8888 and serve configuration data from "file:./steeltoe/config-repo". This will be the directory _Workshop/ConfigServer/steeltoe/config-repo_.

=== Step 02 - Add Steeltoe Config Server Client Nuget
Here we add the appropriate Steeltoe Config Server client Nuget to each Fortune Teller application.
When targeting Spring Cloud Services on PCF, we use the Nuget: ``Pivotal.Extensions.Configuration.ConfigServer``.
When targeting Spring Cloud Open Source, we can use Nuget: ``Steeltoe.Extensions.Configuration.ConfigServer``.

. Expand the ``Fortune-Teller-UI`` and ``Fortune-Teller-Service`` projects.
. Open ``csproj`` for EACH project and add the``PackageReference``:
..  Include="Pivotal.Extensions.Configuration.ConfigServer" Version="1.0.0"
+
----
  <ItemGroup>
   .......
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore" Version="1.0.3" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory" Version="1.0.3" />
    <PackageReference Include="Pivotal.Extensions.Configuration.ConfigServer" version="1.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
----
. Save each ``csproj`` and ensure a dotnet restore is done.

=== Step 03 - Add Steeltoe Config Server provider to ConfigurationBuilder
Here we need to use the Config Server client to retrieve the configuration from the Config Server.
We do this bby adding it as another provider to the Configuration Builder setup.
Notice that we add the provider after the ``AddJsonFile()`` calls for two reasons:

* Config Server client will then be able to pickup its configuration from ``appsettings.json`` or ``appsettings-Development.json``.
* We want the ability for the config values retrieved from the Config Server to 'override' any values in the json files.

. Expand the ``Fortune-Teller-UI`` and ``Fortune-Teller-Service`` projects.
. Open ``Startup.cs`` in each project and add the call ``AddConfigServer(env)``to the ``ConfigurationBuilder``
+
----
    var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
        .SetBasePath(env.ContentRootPath)
        .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true)
        .AddJsonFile($"appsettings.{env.EnvironmentName}.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true)
        .AddConfigServer(env)
        .AddEnvironmentVariables();

        Configuration = builder.Build();
    ......
----

=== Step 04 - Configure the Config Server Client
Once we have the Config Server client added to the ``ConfigurationBuilder``, we next need to configure the client.
At a minimum we need to tell the client what URL to use to make request of the Config Server and what configuration data to request.
We do this by adding the following to the ``appsettings.json`` files in each project:

. Modify the ``Fortune-Teller-Services`` ``appsettings.json`` file to include the following:
+
----
{
  "Logging": {
    "IncludeScopes": false,
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "System": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Information"
    }
  },
 "spring": {
    "application": {
      "name": "fortuneService"
    },
    "cloud": {
      "config": {
        "uri": "http://localhost:8888"
      }
    }
  }
 }
----
. Also, modify the ``Fortune-Teller-UI`` ``appsettings.json`` file to include the following:
+
----
{
  "Logging": {
    "IncludeScopes": false,
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "System": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Information"
    }
  },
 "fortuneService": {
   "scheme": "http",
   "address":"localhost:5000",
   "randomFortunePath": "api/fortunes/random",
   "allFortunesPath": "api/fortunes/all"
 },
  "spring": {
    "application": {
      "name": "fortuneui"
    },
    "cloud": {
      "config": {
        "uri": "http://localhost:8888"
      }
    }
  }
}
----
{sp}+
For more detail on what configuration parameters can be used with the Steeltoe Config Server Client, have a look at https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Configuration/blob/master/src/Steeltoe.Extensions.Configuration.ConfigServer/ConfigServerClientSettings.cs[this]

Once complete, you should be ready to run both and they should both fetch any configuration data from the Config Server.
But, of course we haven't put anything in the Config Servers directory _file:./steeltoe/config-repo_ , the directory its using for its data.
That's what we'll do in the next step.

=== Step 05 - Centralize configuration data
In this step we move some of the configuration data from the ``appsettings`` files to files in the _file:./steeltoe/config-repo_; the directory the Config Server uses to serve configuration data.
Notice that in ``appsettings.json`` there are some configuration settings for logging that are common to both Fortune_Tellers.
Specifically the section on logging:

----
{
  "Logging": {
    "IncludeScopes": false,
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "System": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Information"
    }
  },
  "spring": {
   .....
}
----
So we will go ahead and centralize that in a YAML file ``application.yml`` in the _file:./steeltoe/config-repo_ directory.
Use your favorite editor to create the file and put the following into it:
----
Logging:
  IncludeScopes: false
  LogLevel:
    Default: Information
    System: Information
    Microsoft: Information
----
Next, remove this section from ``appsettings.json`` in both projects.

Also notice that the contents of ``appsettings-Development.json`` is common for both Fortune_Tellers.
So we will also centralize that in a YAML file ``application-Development.yml`` in the _file:./steeltoe/config-repo_ directory.
So again,  use your favorite editor to create the file and put the following into it:
----
Logging:
  IncludeScopes: false
  LogLevel:
    Default: Debug
    System: Debug
    Microsoft: Debug
    Fortune_Teller_Service: Debug
    Fortune_Teller_UI: Debug
----
Next, remove the contents from ``appsettings-Development.json`` in both projects.

Then finally, in the ``appsettings.json`` file for Fortune-Teller-UI there is the ``fortuneService`` section that we would certainly like to manage centrally.
So lets move that content to a YAML file named ``fortuneui.yml`` in the _file:./steeltoe/config-repo_ directory.
Again use your favorite editor to create the file and put the following into it:
----
fortuneService:
  scheme: http
  address: localhost:5000
  randomFortunePath: api/fortunes/random
  allFortunesPath: api/fortunes/all
----
Next, remove this section from ``appsettings.json``.

=== Step 06 - Run Locally
At this point you should be ready to run both Fortune-Tellers locally and test.
Every thing should work as it did before, even though now much of the configuration is coming from the Config Server.

. Using the skills you picked up from Lab05, run the apps from VS2017 and/or from the command line.
.. CTRL-F5 or F5 in VS2017
.. ``dotnet run --server.urls http://*:5000`` - Fortune-Teller-Service
.. ``dotnet run --server.urls http://*:5555`` - Fortune-Teller-UI

== Deploy to Cloud Foundry

=== Step 01 - Setup Config Server
You must first create an instance of the Config Server service in your org/space.

. Open a command window.
. Change directory to your starting lab point:
.. _Workshop/Session-03/Lab07 .... if you started with finished code.
.. _Workshop/FortuneTeller/ .... if you are writing code from scratch.
+
----
> e.g cd Workshop\FortuneTeller
----
. Optional: Create your own github repo to hold the Config Server data

.. Fork github repository https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/workshop-config-repo
.. Open the ``config-server.json`` file in the Solution folder.
.. Modify it to point to the github repo you just forked.
.. Add the contents of _file:./steeltoe/config-repo_ to the github repo you just created. Note you will have to modify the files
. Using the command window, create an instance of the config server and set its configuration up with a github repo referenced in the config-server.json file:
+
----
> Windows: cf create-service p-config-server standard myConfigServer -c .\config-server.json

> Mac/Linux: cf create-service p-config-server standard myConfigServer -c config-server.json
----

. Wait for the service to become available:
+
----
> cf services
----

=== Step 02 - Push to Cloud Foundry
. Examine the ``manfest.yml`` files for both projects and notice ``services`` addition shown below.
You need to make this change in your ``manifest.yml`` before you push to Cloud Foundry.
Also, notice the ``ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT`` setting.
Feel free to change that to ``Development`` if you want to turn on debug logging.
+
----
---
applications:
- name: fortuneService
  random-route: true
  env:
    ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT: Production
  services:
   - myConfigServer

---
applications:
- name: fortuneui
  random-route: true
  env:
    ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT: Production
  services:
   - myConfigServer
----
. Using the skills you picked up from Lab05, publish and push both components to a Linux cell on Cloud Foundry.
.. Pushing Fortune Teller Service - If you are using the finished lab code on Windows:
... ``cd Workshop/Session-02/Lab07/Fortune-Teller-Service``
... ``dotnet restore``
... ``dotnet build ``
... ``dotnet publish -o %CD%\publish -f netcoreapp1.1 -r ubuntu.14.04-x64``
... ``cf push -f manifest.yml -p .\publish``
.. Pushing Fortune Teller Service - If you are using the finished lab code on Mac/Linux:
... ``cd Workshop/Session-02/Lab07/Fortune-Teller-Service``
... ``dotnet restore``
... ``dotnet build ``
... ``dotnet publish -f netcoreapp1.1 -r ubuntu.14.04-x64 -o $PWD/publish``
... ``cf push -f manifest.yml -p publish``
.. Pushing Fortune Teller UI - If you are using the finished lab code on Windows:
... ``cd Workshop/Session-02/Lab07/Fortune-Teller-UI``
... ``dotnet restore``
... ``dotnet build ``
... ``dotnet publish -o %CD%\publish -f netcoreapp1.1 -r ubuntu.14.04-x64``
... ``cf push -f manifest.yml -p .\publish``
.. Pushing Fortune Teller UI - If you are using the finished lab code on Mac/Linux:
... ``cd Workshop/Session-02/Lab07/Fortune-Teller-UI``
... ``dotnet restore``
... ``dotnet build ``
... ``dotnet publish -f netcoreapp1.1 -r ubuntu.14.04-x64 -o $PWD/publish``
... ``cf push -f manifest.yml -p publish``



=== Step 03 - Configure for CloudFoundry
. Try hitting the ``Fortune Teller UI`` and notice that it fails to communicate with the ``Fortune Teller Service``.
Why -> Remember the ``fortuneService`` configuration is pointing to ``localhost:5000``. In the next lab, we will fix this by making use of the Netflix Eureka Discovery service.
. Optional: If you're using your own github repo to hold Config Server data, modify the ``fortuneService`` configuration to make it work and restart the UI.
Some hints:
.. Check the application fortuneService URL in the Route tab within Pivotal Cloud Foundry apps manager

.. Update fortuneui.yml in your github repo and restart fortuneui application
