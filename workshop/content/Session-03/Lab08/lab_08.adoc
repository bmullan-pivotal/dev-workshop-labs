= Lab 8 - Service Discovery and Steeltoe Eureka Client

[abstract]
--
In this lab we will continue to add functionality to the Fortune Teller application.
We will explore how to use Netflix Eureka for service registration and discovery using the Steeltoe Discovery client.

If you started with the _FortuneTeller.sln_, and completed Lab 7, you have an app that is still not where we would like it to be:

. The ``Fortune Teller Service`` uses a backend in-memory datastore to hold  Fortunes.
. The ``Fortune Teller UI`` uses a configurable ``FortuneServiceClient``  service to communicate with the ``Fortune Teller Service``.
.. But we have to reconfigure the ``Fortune Teller UI`` every time we change the address of the ``Fortune Teller Service``

The goals for Lab 8 are to:

. Use Spring Cloud Eureka Server for Service Registration and Discovery
. Use Steeltoe Discovery client to register and discover the ``Fortune Teller Service``
--

== Open Visual Studio Solution
. Start Visual Studio and open the solution/folder you wish to use:
.. _Workshop/Session-03/Lab08.sln_ if you want to start with finished code.
.. _Workshop/FortuneTeller/FortuneTeller.sln_ if you are writing code from scratch.


== Use Spring Cloud Eureka Server as a Discovery server

=== Step 01 - Run Spring Cloud Eureka Server Locally
Here we need to make sure a Spring Cloud Eureka Server is running locally so its easier to develop and test with.

. To run Eureka Server you will need Java JDK installed on your machine and the JAVA_HOME environment variable set to the JDK's installed location:
+
----
e.g. JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_112 or equivalent on Linux/Mac
----

. Open a command window.
. Change directory to _Workshop/EurekaServer_
+
----
> cd Workshop\EurekaServer
----

. Startup the eureka server
+
----
> mvnw spring-boot:run
----
{sp}+
It will start up on port 8761 and serve the Eureka API from "/eureka".

=== Step 02 - Run Spring Cloud Config Server Locally
We are still using the Config Server, so we make sure it is running locally so its easier to develop and test with.

. To run Config Server you will need Java JDK installed on your machine and the JAVA_HOME environment variable set to the JDK's installed location:
+
----
e.g. JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_112 or equivalent on Linux/Mac
----

. Open a command window.

. Change directory to _Workshop/ConfigServer_
+
----
> cd Workshop\ConfigServer
----

. Startup the config server
+
----
> mvnw spring-boot:run
----
{sp}+
It will start up on port 8888 and serve configuration data from "file:./steeltoe/config-repo". This will be the directory _Workshop/ConfigServer/steeltoe/config-repo_.


=== Step 03 - Add Steeltoe Discovery Client Nuget
Here we add the appropriate Spring Cloud Eureka Server client Nuget to each Fortune Teller application.
When targeting Spring Cloud Services on PCF, we use the Nuget: ``Pivotal.Discovery.Client``.
When targeting Spring Cloud Open Source, we can use Nuget: ``Steeltoe.Discovery.Client``.

. Expand the ``Fortune-Teller-UI`` and ``Fortune-Teller-Service`` projects.
. Open ``.csproj`` for EACH project and add the``PackageReference``:
..  Include="Pivotal.Discovery.Client" Version="1.0.0"

+
----
  <ItemGroup>
   .......
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore" Version="1.0.3" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory" Version="1.0.3" />
    <PackageReference Include="Pivotal.Extensions.Configuration.ConfigServer" version="1.0.0" />
    <PackageReference Include="Pivotal.Discovery.Client" version="1.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
----
. Save each ``csproj`` and make sure that a ``dotnet restore`` is done.

=== Step 04 - Add Steeltoe Discovery Client to Container
In this step we need to add the Steeltoe Discovery Client to the service container and the start it up, running in the background, fetching Service information.
We do this by adding it as another service to the ``IServiceCollection`` in ``ConfigureServices``.

. Expand the ``Fortune-Teller-UI`` and ``Fortune-Teller-Service`` projects.
. Open ``Startup.cs`` in each project and modify the ``ConfigureServices`` method to include a call to ``AddDiscoveryClient(Configuration)``:
+
----
 public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
.....
        services.AddSingleton<IFortuneRepository, FortuneRepository>();

        services.AddDiscoveryClient(Configuration);

        // Add framework services.
        services.AddMvc();
......
}
----
. Then we also need to start the Discovery client running in the background.
To do this we add a ``UseDiscoveryClient()`` method call in  ``Configure()`` method.
+
----
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
{
.....
    app.UseMvc();

    app.UseDiscoveryClient();
.....
}
----

=== Step 04 - Configure the Discovery Client
Once we have the Discovery client added to the service container we next need to configure the client.
We have two sets of Discovery client configuration data to provide, one for the ``Fortune Teller Service`` and the other for ``Fortune Teller UI``.
For the ``Fortune Teller Service`` we want it to register itself with the Eureka Server, but we don't need it to fetch any services as it doesn't make any external service requests.
For the ``Fortune Teller UI`` we want it to fetch registered services, but we don't need to register, as it has no external REST endpoints it needs to expose.
And finally, for both, we need to configure the URL endpoint of the Eureka Server, so that both know how to contact the server.

. Modify the ``application.yml`` file in _file:./steeltoe/config-repo_ to contain:
+
----
Logging:
  IncludeScopes: false
  LogLevel:
    Default: Information
    System: Information
    Microsoft: Information
eureka:
  client:
    serviceUrl: http://localhost:8761/eureka/
----
{sp}+
So in the above, we configure the usage of the ``eureka client`` and we configure the endpoint (``serviceUrl`` of the Eureka server.
Since this data is contained in ``application.yml`` it will be returned for ALL (e.g. fortuneService and fortuneui) applications which fetch data from this server.
. Modify the ``fortuneService.yml`` file in _file:./steeltoe/config-repo_ to contain:
+
----
eureka:
  client:
    shouldFetchRegistry: false
  instance:
    port: 5000
    hostName: localhost
----
{sp}+
Since the above information is contained in ``fortuneService.yml``, it applies to all apps with the ``spring:name`` == ``fortuneService``.
Here we tell the client to not fetch any service registry information (``shouldFetchRegistry: false``).
Then we tell it to register itself as an ``instance``, listening at the address ``localhost:5000``.
Note that the name for ``Fortune Teller Service`` comes from ``appsettings.json``. (``spring:name`` = ``fortuneService``).
All of this should work fine when running locally and we will override some of it with the Eureka service binding when we push it to Cloud Foundry.

. Modify the ``fortuneui.yml`` file in _file:./steeltoe/config-repo_ to contain:
+
----
eureka:
  client:
    shouldRegisterWithEureka: false

fortuneService:
  scheme: http
  address: fortuneService
  randomFortunePath: api/fortunes/random
  allFortunesPath: api/fortunes/all
----
{sp}+
Since the above information is contained in ``fortuneui.yml``, it applies to all apps with the ``spring:name`` == ``fortuneui``.
Here we tell the client to go ahead and fetch any service registry information; the default is (``shouldFetchRegistry: true``).
Then we tell it NOT register itself (``shouldRegisterWithEureka: false``) and so we don't provide any ``instance`` configuration data.
Note that the name for ``Fortune Teller UI`` comes from ``appsettings.json``. (``spring:name`` = ``fortuneui``).
Also notice that we changed ``address`` in the ``fortuneService``. Instead of using ``localhost:5000`` like before, we use the name of the ``Fortune Teller Service`` registered with Eureka.
All of this should work fine when running locally and we will override some of it with the Eureka service binding when we push it to Cloud Foundry.

=== Step 05 - Discover Services - DiscoveryHttpClientHandler
Last code change we have to make to get the Discovery service fully implemented and used is to change the ``FortuneServiceClient`` to use the ``IDiscoveryClient``.
The ``AddDiscoveryClient(Configuration)`` that we added to the container in the ``ConfigureServices()`` method adds ``IDiscoveryClient`` to the service container.
To to get access to this in the ``FortuneServiceClient``,  we will need to add ``IDiscoveryClient`` to its constructor.

Once this is done, we could go ahead and use ``IDiscoveryClient`` directly to lookup services, but instead what we will do is use another Steeltoe component ``DiscoveryHttpClientHandler`` to make our life easier.
The ``DiscoveryHttpClientHandler`` is an ``HttpClientHandler`` that can be used with an ``HttpClient`` to intercept any client requests and evaluate the request URL to see if the address portion of the URL can be resolved from the service registry.
In this case we will use it to resolve the "fortuneService" name into an actual host:port before allowing the request to continue.
If the name can't be resolved the handler will still allow the request to continue, but of course the request will fail.

. Expand the Common/Services folder.
. Open ``FortuneServiceClient`` and modify the constructor as follows:
+
----
DiscoveryHttpClientHandler _handler;
public FortuneServiceClient(IDiscoveryClient client, IOptionsSnapshot<FortuneServiceConfig> config, ILogger<FortuneServiceClient> logger)
{
    _handler = new DiscoveryHttpClientHandler(client);
    _logger = logger;
    _config = config;
}
----
. Next, locate the ``GetClient()`` method and modify it to use the handler:
+
----
private HttpClient GetClient()
{
    var client = new HttpClient(_handler, false);
    return client;
}
----

=== Step 06 - Run Locally
At this point you should be ready to run both Fortune-Tellers locally and test.
Every thing should work as it did before, but now we are using Eureka for service registration and discovery.

. Using the skills you picked up from Lab05, run the apps from VS2017 and/or from the command line.
.. CTRL-F5 or F5 on VS2017
.. ``dotnet run --server.urls http://*:5000`` - Fortune-Teller-Service
.. ``dotnet run --server.urls http://*:5555`` - Fortune-Teller-UI

== Deploy to Cloud Foundry

=== Step 01 - Setup Eureka Server
You must first create an instance of the Eureka Server service in your org/space if you haven't already done so.

. Open a command window.
. Using the command window, create an instance of the Eureka server:
+
----
> cf create-service p-service-registry standard myDiscoveryService
----

. Wait for the service to become available:
+
----
> cf services
----

=== Step 02 - Setup Config Server
Make sure you still have an instance of the Config Server service in your org/space. If you don't:

. Open a command window.
. Change directory to your starting lab point:
.. _Workshop/Session-03/Lab09 .... if you started with finished code.
.. _Workshop/FortuneTeller/ .... if you are writing code from scratch.
+
----
> e.g cd Workshop\FortuneTeller
----
. Optional: Create your own github repo to hold the Config Server data

.. Optional: Fork github repository https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/workshop-config-repo
.. Optional: Open the ``config-server.json`` file in the Solution Items folder.
.. Optional: Modify it to point to the github repo you just created.
.. Optional: Add the contents of _file:./steeltoe/config-repo_ to the github repo you just created
. Using the command window, create an instance of the config server and set its configuration up with a github repo referenced in the config-server.json file:
+
----
> Windows: cf create-service p-config-server standard myConfigServer -c .\config-server.json

> Mac/Linux: cf create-service p-config-server standard myConfigServer -c config-server.json
----

. Wait for the service to become available:
+
----
> cf services
----


==== Step 03 - Push to Cloud Foundry
. Examine the ``manfest.yml`` files for both projects and notice ``services`` addition shown below.
You need to make this change in your ``manifest.yml`` before you push to Cloud Foundry.
Also, notice the ``ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT`` setting.
Feel free to change that to ``Development`` if you want to turn on debug logging.
+
----
---
applications:
- name: fortuneService
  random-route: true
  env:
    ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT: Production
  services:
   - myConfigServer
   - myDiscoveryService

---
applications:
- name: fortuneui
  random-route: true
  env:
    ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT: Production
  services:
   - myConfigServer
   - myDiscoveryService

----
. Using the skills you picked from Lab05, publish and push the components to a Linux cell on Cloud Foundry.
.. Pushing Fortune Teller Service - If you are using the finished lab code on Windows:
... ``cd Workshop/Session-03/Lab08/Fortune-Teller-Service``
... ``dotnet restore``
... ``dotnet build ``
... ``dotnet publish -o %CD%\publish -f netcoreapp1.1 -r ubuntu.14.04-x64``
... ``cf push -f manifest.yml -p .\publish``
.. Pushing Fortune Teller Service - If you are using the finished lab code on Mac/Linux:
... ``cd Workshop/Session-03/Lab08/Fortune-Teller-Service``
... ``dotnet restore``
... ``dotnet build ``
... ``dotnet publish -f netcoreapp1.1 -r ubuntu.14.04-x64 -o $PWD/publish``
... ``cf push -f manifest.yml -p publish``
.. Pushing Fortune Teller UI - If you are using the finished lab code on Windows:
... ``cd Workshop/Session-03/Lab08/Fortune-Teller-UI``
... ``dotnet restore``
... ``dotnet build ``
... ``dotnet publish -o %CD%\publish -f netcoreapp1.1 -r ubuntu.14.04-x64``
... ``cf push -f manifest.yml -p .\publish``
.. Pushing Fortune Teller UI - If you are using the finished lab code on Mac/Linux:
... ``cd Workshop/Session-03/Lab08/Fortune-Teller-UI``
... ``dotnet restore``
... ``dotnet build ``
... ``dotnet publish -f netcoreapp1.1 -r ubuntu.14.04-x64 -o $PWD/publish``
... ``cf push -f manifest.yml -p publish``

Try hitting the ``Fortune Teller UI`` and if it fails to communicate with the ``Fortune Teller Service``.
make sure fortuneui.yml file us updated as follows "address: fortuneService".
