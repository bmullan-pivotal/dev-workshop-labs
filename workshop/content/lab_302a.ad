## `Exercises`


=== `Preparing for Cloud Foundry`

. Create `manifest.yml` file under `springbox-catalog` and copy the following contents:
+
----
---
applications:
- name: springbox-catalog
  host: springbox-catalog
  memory: 1G
  random-route: true
  instances: 1
  path: target/springbox-catalog-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  env:
    SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: cloud
  timeout: 120
  
----

. Add the following code to the class `application.yml`:

management:
  security:
    enabled: false
  info:
    git:
      mode: full                #<== Add this 
  cloudfoundry:
    skip-ssl-validation: true   #<== Add this 
      
security:
  basic:
    enabled: false
 
logging:                        #<== Add this

. Rebuild the JAR:
+
----
$ mvn package
----

. Push to Cloud Foundry:
+
----
$ cf push

The next step is optional. You can continue the next lab using the workspace that you have created, or clean up and follow the next lab from scratch.

Let's clean up our application so that we can have a clean start for the next lab 

. Delete the project from your IDE

. Delete the application:
