## Lab 01 - Command Line Interface


## `Goal`
--
Install the command line interface (CLI) and log into *PCF Dev* Env.

Approximate time: 10 minutes
--

## `Exercise`  

### `Install PCF Dev`

. In a browser, navigate to https://network.pivotal.io and login with your username and password
. Click on 'PCF Dev'
. Download the latest zip file
. Unzip pcfdev-<version>.zip 

### `Start PCF Dev`
. From the unzipped folder run start-osx

### `Install the CLI`
. Check to see if you have a CLI already installed. Open a terminal/command window and type `cf --version`. If you see that you have an installed version of 6.x or greater, you can skip the install.

. Go to https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases or https://console.run.pivotal.io/tools. Download and run the installer for your platform.

. Verify your install by opening a terminal/command window and typing `cf --version`. You now have a Cloud Foundry client that can communicate with any Cloud Foundry installation.

### `Explore cf help`
. Type `cf help`. Scroll through the list of commands available to the CLI. Notice that they are organized by category. You will become familiar with most of the categories in this course.

. Type `cf help login`. Use this approach whenever you need a refresher on any of the CLI commands. Because login has an alias, you could have also have typed cf help l.

### `Log into *PCF Dev* with the CLI`
. From the command line log in the *PCF Dev* environment

. Set the API target for the CLI:
+
----
$ cf login -a api.local.pcfdev.io --skip-ssl-validation
----
+
. Use 'admin' for username and password 
+
Once you have logged in, type cf target to view your current API endpoint, User, Org and Space.

### `View the .cf directory`
. On your local machineâ€™s file system, navigate to your home directory and find the .cf directory. It may be hidden depending on your settings.

. Open the config.json file and notice that your connection settings are cached in that file.

### `If you have time`
. Browse the commands in cf help and see what you discover.
